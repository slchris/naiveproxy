## Environment

Environment Preparation

- Domain Name

- docker
- docker-compose

## Quick start

```shell
mkdir -pv  /opt/naiveproxy/
```

Create docker-compose file

```yaml
# vi /opt/naiveproxy/docker-compose.yaml
version: "3"

services:

  naiveproxy:
    image: ghcr.io/slchris/naiveproxy:v1
    container_name: naiveproxy
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      - /opt/naiveproxy/Caddyfile:/app/Caddyfile
    command: /app/caddy run
```

Create caddy file

```json
:443, example.com
tls admin@example.com
route {
        forward_proxy {
                basic_auth user password
                hide_ip
                hide_via
                probe_resistance
        }
        reverse_proxy https://demo.cloudreve.org {
                header_up Host {upstream_hostport}
                header_up X-Forwarded-Host {host}
        }
}
```
